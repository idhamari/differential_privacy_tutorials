Welcome to the  Differential Privacy world!

In these tutorials, I will try to explain Differential Privacy (DP) in a practical way with examples using simple Python scripts. I will try to add more details, examples, and scripts whenever I find the time, so please consider this work in progress.

If you have questions, corrections, or comments, please use the discussion feature.
